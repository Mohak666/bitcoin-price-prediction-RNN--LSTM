# bitcoin-price-prediction-RNN--LSTM

Here I am trying to predict Future bitcoin price using recurrent neural networks.
Trying to implement a multi layer LSTM network to obtain high accuracy.

Using Python 3.6.7, packages used-
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow(using keras from it, cause now keras is available in tensorflow)
matplotlib/seaborn
